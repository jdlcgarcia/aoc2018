## Day 1: Chronal Calibration
For today's problem let's just sum the lines with the initial frequency (0). I've done it in PERL.
The second part of the problem handles a sum on multiple iterations of an array. It may be a cleaner way to iterate this, but it's late and I'm tired. It worked on the examples, it worked on the solution.
